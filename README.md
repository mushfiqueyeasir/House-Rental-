        <strong>Introduction: </strong>Every month many families change their house. They have to search for weeks
        before finds the perfect house for themselves. It’s really takes time and energy to search house in your desired
        location with your budget. So, we are going to reduce their time and make it comfortable for them so they can
        search house while sitting in their home with a phone or laptop. There will be two types of user. One who wants
        to rent a house and other who own the house. The user who want to rent a house all he has to do search his
        desired location and all the house for rent will be shown to him with price and all other utilities. All he has
        to do is chose the hose and contact the owner with the provided contact number or email. And the other user will
        be posting this house for rent with some photos, location, utility’s and price with his contact number. If both
        sides agreed all the house owner has to do is go to his post and make it taken. The system won’t show it to the
        other user any more.
